/************************************************************************************************/
If You Are a Matchmaker...

Imagine you are a Matchmaker
  One hundred female clients, and one hundred male clients
  Each woman has given you a complete list of the hundred men, ordered by her preference: first 
  choice, second choice, and so on
  Each man has given you a list of women, ranked analogously
  Your job is to arrange one hundred "happy" marriages
    Neither singlehood nor polygamy
    Happy and stable (You don't want them to divorce or to develop outside relationships)
/************************************************************************************************/

example:

men: X, Y, Z ; women: A, B, C

Men's preference
    1st   2nd   3rd
X    A     B     C
Y    B     A     C
Z    A     B     C

Women's preference
    1st   2nd   3rd
A    Y     X     Z
B    X     Y     Z
C    X     Y     Z

配對結果不能存在更好的配對方式
Perfect matching: Everyone is matched monogamously
  Each man gets exactly one woman
  Each woman gets exactly one man
Stablility: No incentive for some pair of participants to undermine assignment by joint action.
  In matching M, an unmatched pair(m, w) is unstable if man m and woman w prefer each other to current partners.
  Unstable pair(m, w) could each improve by eloping.

Stable matching: Perfect matching without unstable pairs.

The stable matching problem: Given the preference lists of n men and n women, find a stable matching if one exists.

想法1.
Random matching and fixing up => Simple-But-Invalid
  1. Start with some matching
  2. while (there is an unstable pair) don
  3.  Swap mates to make the pair stable

  2, 3不實際，每次解掉一個pair可能造成新的不stable的pair => while迴圈走不完
  Q: Valid?
  A: This will NOT work since a loop can occur. Swaps can be made that might continually result in unstable pairs.
     May not terminate...

想法2. Propose and Reject (by Gale and Shapley 1962)
